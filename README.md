# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The goal is to classify whether a customer is likely to leave a bank based on various features like credit score, geography, age, and account information.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Problem**: Predict if a customer will churn based on historical data.
- **Model**: ANN using TensorFlow and Keras
- **Dataset**: Contains customer demographic and financial data.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib

## 🧠 Key Steps

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
   - Handle categorical variables
   - Perform feature scaling
2. Build ANN Model
   - Use Keras `Sequential` API
   - Add input, hidden, and output layers
3. Compile and Train the Model
4. Evaluate Model Performance
   - Accuracy score
   - Confusion matrix
